Question 1: Single Server (M/M/1 Queue)
            A bank counter serves customers at an average rate of 10 customers/hour (μ = 10).
            Customers arrive at an average rate of 6 customers/hour (λ = 6).

            Find:
            1. System utilization (ρ)
            2. Average number of customers in the system (L)
            3. Average waiting time in the system (W)


Question 2: Multi-Server (M/M/s Queue)
            A call center has 3 operators (s = 3).
            Each can handle 12 calls/hour (μ = 12),
            and calls arrive at 25 per hour (λ = 25).

            Find:
            1. Server utilization (ρ)
            2. Average number of customers being served at a time
            3. What happens if one more operator is added?


Question 3: Two Servers at Toll Booth (M/M/s Queue)
            A toll booth has 2 servers, each serving 20 vehicles/hour (μ = 20).
            Vehicles arrive at a rate of 30 per hour (λ = 30).

            Find:
            1. Server utilization.
            2. Total service rate of the system
            3. If arrival rate increases to 36 vehicles/hour, what is the new utilization?








Question 1: Single Server (M/M/1 Queue)
            A bank counter serves customers at an average rate of 10 customers/hour (μ = 10).
            Customers arrive at an average rate of 6 customers/hour (λ = 6).

            Find:
            1. System utilization (ρ)
            2. Average number of customers in the system (L)
            3. Average waiting time in the system (W)

    Solution:
            ρ   = λ / μ
                = 6 / 10
                = 0.6

            L   = ρ / (1 - ρ)
                = 0.6 / (1 - 0.6)
                = 0.6 / 0.4
                = 1.5 customers

            W   = L / λ
                = 1.5 / 6
                = 0.25 hours = 15 minutes

        Final Answers:
            ρ = 0.6
            L = 1.5 customers
            W = 0.25 hr (15 min)


Question 2: Multi-Server (M/M/s Queue)
            A call center has 3 operators (s = 3).
            Each can handle 12 calls/hour (μ = 12),
            and calls arrive at 25 per hour (λ = 25).

            Find:
            1. Server utilization (ρ)
            2. Average number of customers being served at a time
            3. What happens if one more operator is added?

    Solution:
            ρ   = λ / (s × μ)
                = 25 / (3 × 12)
                = 25 / 36
                = 0.6944

            Average number of busy servers = λ / μ
                = 25 / 12
                = 2.0833 servers

            If one more operator is added (s = 4):
            ρ(new) = 25 / (4 × 12)
                = 25 / 48
                = 0.5208

            Final Answers:
            ρ = 0.6944
            Average busy servers = 2.0833
            With one more operator, ρ(new) = 0.5208
            (Result: Less waiting time, more idle capacity)


Question 3: Two Servers at Toll Booth (M/M/2 Queue)
            A toll booth has 2 servers, each serving 20 vehicles/hour (μ = 20).
            Vehicles arrive at a rate of 30 per hour (λ = 30).

            Find:
            1. Server utilization (ρ)
            2. Total service rate of the system
            3. If arrival rate increases to 36 vehicles/hour, what is the new utilization?

        Solution:
            ρ   = λ / (s × μ)
                = 30 / (2 × 20)
                = 30 / 40
                = 0.75

            Total service rate = s × μ
                            = 2 × 20
                            = 40 vehicles/hour

            If arrival rate increases to 36 vehicles/hour:
            ρ(new)  = 36 / 40
                    = 0.9

            Final Answers:
            ρ = 0.75
            Total service rate = 40 vehicles/hour
            ρ(new) = 0.9 (System becomes more congested)
