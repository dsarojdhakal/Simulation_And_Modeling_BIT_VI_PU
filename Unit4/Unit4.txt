Unit 4: Random Numbers

    4.1 Random Numbers

        - Random numbers are numbers that appear in no particular order and can take any value in a range.
        - They are very useful in simulation to represent events that happen by chance, 
            like arrival times, service times, or other random choices.
        - Using random numbers helps us create simulation models that behave like real-world systems.

        - There are two types of random numebers:
            - True random number
            - Pseudo random number

        - True random numbers come from natural processes that are unpredictable, like radioactive decay or thermal noise.
        - These numbers are independent, non-repeating, and evenly spread over the range.
        - True random numbers are hard to generate with computers, so they are mostly used in experiments or special hardware.

        - Computers usually use pseudo random numbers:
            - These are created by formulas or algorithms.
            - They look random but can be repeated if we start with the same seed.
            - They are easy to generate and widely used in simulations.

        - Random numbers are usually written as decimals between 0 and 1.
          Example: 0.2314, 0.7853, 0.9921


    4.2 Random Number Tables

        - Random number tables are lists of numbers that seem random and are ready to use in simulations.
        - They help us simulate random events without having to create numbers ourselves.
        - Each number in the table has an equal chance of being picked.
        - Numbers are usually shown as decimals between 0 and 1 or as integers in a certain range.
        - Using a table makes it easier to plan and run simulations step by step.
        - They are especially helpful when we need many random numbers for calculations.
        - Random numbers from the table can be adjusted to any range we need.
        - They are often used in schools, training, or small projects to show how random events work.

        Advantages:
            - Easy to use, especially for manual simulations.
            - Saves time because we don’t need to make numbers every time.
            - Useful for learning and understanding how random events work.

        How to Use a Random Number Table:
            1. Decide how many random numbers you need.
            2. Pick numbers from the table, either in order or by skipping rows.
            3. Change the numbers to match the range you need.

               Example: If the table gives 0.723 and we want a number between 2 and 6,
                   Random Value = 2 + (6 - 2) × 0.723 = 4.892



    4.3 Pseudo Random Numbers

        - Pseudo random numbers are numbers generated by computers using mathematical formulas or algorithms. 
        - They are not truly random, but they appear random and can simulate real-world uncertainty in systems. 
        - The sequence of pseudo random numbers can be repeated if we start with the same initial value, called a seed. 
        - They are easy to generate, fast, and widely used in computer-based simulations.

        - The main Concept is to create numbers that behave like random numbers using deterministic methods. 
        - Each number in the sequence depends on the previous number and the chosen formula. 
        - They are suitable for modeling random events like arrival times, service times, or system failures.

        - Mostly used method to generate pseudo random numbers:
            Linear Congruential Generator (LCG):
                Rn+1 = (a × Rn + c) mod m
            Where:
                
        - Properties of good pseudo random numbers:
            - Numbers are evenly spread over the range(Uniformity).
            - Numbers do not show patterns or correlations(Independence).
            - The sequence repeats only after a large number of values(Long period).

        - Advantages:
            - Easy to generate large sequences of numbers.
            - Can reproduce results using the same seed for testing.
            - Works well for computer simulations where true random numbers are hard to generate.




    4.4 Generation of Random Numbers

        - Random numbers can be generated using different methods depending on whether we need true random numbers or pseudo random numbers.
        - True random numbers come from unpredictable natural processes, while pseudo random numbers are generated by computer algorithms using a seed.

        - methods for generating pseudo random numbers:

            1. Linear Congruential Generator (LCG):
                - Simple and widely used for simulations.
                - Formula: 
                    
                    Rn+1 = (a × Rn + c) mod m

                    Rn = current random number
                    Rn+1 = next random number
                    a = multiplier
                    c = increment
                    m = modulus (range of numbers)
                    R0 = seed (starting number)

                    Example: If a = 5, c = 3, m = 16, and R0 = 7, we can calculate the next numbers using this formula.


             -> (*) Rule of Normalization for LCG
    
                    1.Raw numbers from LCG
                    
                        - The LCG generates numbers Rn in the range:
                            0 ≤ Rn < m
                        - Where m is the modulus.

                    2. Normalize to [0,1]
                    
                        (*)Formula:R_normalized = Rn / (m - 1)
                        
                        - Why m - 1?  
                            Because the maximum value generated is m−1, 
                            so dividing by m−1 ensures the largest number becomes exactly 1.  
                        - After this, every number is in the range [0,1].

                    3. Scale to any desired range [a,b]


                        (Formula: Y = a + (b - a) × R_normalized)


                        Example: If a = 50 and b = 80, then  Y = 50 + 30 × R_normalized

                    Example: Suppose LCG gives Rn = 14, modulus m = 18  

                        1. Normalize:
                            R_normalized = 14 / (18 - 1) = 14 / 17 ≈ 0.8235

                        2. Scale to [50,80]:
                            Y = 50 + 30 × 0.8235 ≈ 74.71

                
            2. Mid-Square Method:
                - Take a number (seed), square it, and extract the middle digits as the next random number.
                - It is simple but works best with properly chosen seeds and number of digits.
                - Example: 
                    Seed = 1234, 
                    Square = 1522756, 
                    Middle digits = 227 → next random number
                - Simple but works best with properly chosen seeds and number of digits.

        - Steps to generate random numbers:
            1. Choose a method (LCG, mid-square, or others).
            2. Select a starting number (seed).
            3. Apply the formula or algorithm to get the next number.
            4. Repeat to generate as many numbers as needed.
            5. If needed, scale the numbers to fit the required range.



    4.5 MID-SQUARE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR

        - The Mid-Square Method is a simple mathematical approach to generate pseudo-random numbers.
        - It was proposed by John von Neumann (1949).
        - The idea is to start with an initial number called a seed, square it, and extract the 
            middle digits as the next random number.
        - The new number becomes the next seed, and the process repeats to produce a sequence of random numbers.

        - Simple and easy to understand.
        - Demonstrates the concept of pseudo-random number generation.
        - Works well for teaching, learning, and small-scale simulations.
        - Not suitable for large-scale or cryptographic applications.
        - The period (sequence length before repetition) depends on the seed.
        - Poorly chosen seeds can lead to quick repetition or zero values.

        Algorithm (Steps):
        1. Choose a starting number (seed) with a fixed number of digits (N).
        2. Square the seed to get a number of up to 2N digits.
        3. If the square has fewer than 2N digits, pad it with leading zeros.
        4. Extract the middle N digits — these become the next random number.
        5. Use this number as the new seed.
        6. Repeat steps 2–5 to generate more random numbers.

            Example 1:Generate 6 random numbers from Seed = 8765  (N = 4)

                1. Square the seed:
                    8765^2 = 76899025

                2. Pad with zeros to make 8 digits (2N = 8):
                    76899025   ← already 8 digits, so no padding needed

                3. Extract the middle 4 digits:
                    8990

                4. Next seed = 8990

                (Repeat with 8990 to continue the sequence)



       -> (*)Generating Random Numbers in a Range Using Mid-Square Method

            1 Generate a pseudo-random number
            
            - Use the Mid-Square Method: seed → square → middle digits → next seed.
            - Let’s say your middle digits produce a number X.

            2 Normalize to [0,1]
            
                Formula:   R = X / (10^N - 1)
                
                - N = number of digits in the seed.
                - Example: N = 4 → maximum 4-digit number = 9999
                - If X = 2275 → R = 2275 / 9999 ≈ 0.2275
                - Now R is a value between 0 and 1.

            3 Scale to desired range [a, b]
            
                Formula: Y = a + (b - a) * R

                Example: a = 100, b = 150
                Y = 100 + (150 − 100) × 0.2275
                Y = 100 + 50 × 0.2275 ≈ 111.38

            So random number in the range 100–150 is ≈ 111




        Example 2: Generate 6 random numbers from Seed = 8765  (N = 4)

                2. Extract the middle 4 digits:
                    8201
                3. Next seed = 8201

            Iteration 3:
                1. Square the seed:

                2. Extract the middle 4 digits:
                    2564
                3. Next seed = 2564

            Iteration 4:
                1. Square the seed:
                    2564^2 = 6564096  → pad to 8 digits: 06564096
                2. Extract the middle 4 digits:
                    5640
                3. Next seed = 5640

            Iteration 5:
                1. Square the seed:
                    5640^2 = 31809600
                2. Extract the middle 4 digits:
                    8096
                3. Next seed = 8096

            Iteration 6:
                1. Square the seed:
                    8096^2 = 65540116
                2. Extract the middle 4 digits:
                    5401
                3. Next seed = 5401

            (Repeat the process to continue the sequence)

        Iteration 1:
            1. Square the seed:

            4. Scale to [100,200]:
                Y = 100 + 100 * 0.8541 ≈ 185.41
            5. Next seed = 8540

        Iteration 2:
            1. Square the seed:

    4.6 Qualities of an Efficient Random Number Generator

        - A good random number generator should produce numbers that behave like true random numbers. 
        - It ensures simulations give realistic and reliable results.
 
        - Qualities of an Efficient Random Number Generator are:

            1. Uniformity
                - Numbers are spread evenly across the range.
                - No number appears more often than others.

            2. Independence
                - Each number is not affected by previous numbers.
                - No patterns should appear.

            3. Reproducibility
                - Using the same seed gives the same sequence of numbers.
                - Useful for testing and checking simulations.

            4. Long Period
                - The sequence repeats only after a very large number of numbers.
                - Prevents numbers from repeating too soon.

            5. Efficiency
                - Numbers are generated quickly.
                - Uses less memory and processing power.

            6. Simplicity
                - Easy to implement and understand.
                - Good for learning and small simulations.


    4.7 Testing Random Numbers for Randomness

        - In simulations and computer models, we often use random numbers to represent real-world uncertainty.  
        But the numbers generated by computers are not truly random; they are called pseudo-random numbers, 
        because they are made using mathematical formulas.  
        - Even though they look random, there can sometimes be hidden patterns or uneven distribution.  
        That’s why we need to test them — to check if they behave like real random numbers.

        Purpose of Testing Random Numbers:
        1. To make sure the generated numbers behave like real random values.
        2. To confirm that there are no patterns or predictable sequences.
        3. To verify that all numbers are fairly spread across the possible range.
        4. To ensure the random numbers give correct and unbiased simulation results.
        5. To check if the random number generator is working properly.

        Why We Need to Test Random Numbers:
        - Computers use fixed formulas, so patterns may appear after many numbers.
        - If randomness is weak, simulation results can become wrong or biased.
        - In areas like banking or security, poor randomness can cause serious errors.
        - Testing ensures that the generated numbers are fair, reliable, and truly random-like.

        Categories of Randomness Tests:
        There are mainly two types of tests used to check randomness:

            1. Tests for Uniformity:
            - These tests check whether numbers are evenly spread across a given range.
            - Each part of the range (like 0.0–0.1, 0.1–0.2, etc.) should get nearly the same number of random values.
            - Common examples are the Chi-Square Test and Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test.

            2. Tests for Independence:
            - These tests check if one number is independent of the next one.
            - There should be no visible pattern or relationship between numbers.
            - Common examples are Runs Test, Autocorrelation Test, and Serial Test.

        Types of  Randomness Tests:
            1. Uniformity Test – Checks if random numbers are evenly spread over the interval 0 to 1.
            2. Chi-Square Test – Compares observed frequencies with expected frequencies.
            3. Runs Test – Checks whether numbers come in random order without any pattern.
            4. Autocorrelation Test 
            6. Gap Test 
            7. Poker Test
