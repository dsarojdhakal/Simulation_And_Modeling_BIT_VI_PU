Question 1: A single-server queue (M/M/1) is simulated for 15 customers. 
            The waiting times (in minutes) are:  2, 4, 6, 5, 4, 7, 5, 6, 4, 5, 7, 6, 5, 6, 5

            Calculate the sample mean, sample variance, lag-1 autocorrelation, adjusted variance of 
            the mean, and the 95% confidence interval of the mean waiting time. Interpret the results.
Solution:

    Step 1: Calculate sample mean
        Formula: x̄ = Σ x(i) / n

        Sum of waiting times: 2 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 78

        Number of observations: n = 15

        x̄ = 78 / 15 = 5.2

    Step 2: Calculate sample variance
        Formula: s² = (1 / (n - 1)) * Σ (x(i) - x̄)²

        Compute deviations and squared deviations:

        | x(i) | x(i)-x̄  | (x(i)-x̄)²  |
        | 2    | -3.2    | 10.24      |
        | 4    | -1.2    | 1.44       |
        | 6    | 0.8     | 0.64       |
        | 5    | -0.2    | 0.04       |
        | 4    | -1.2    | 1.44       |
        | 7    | 1.8     | 3.24       |
        | 5    | -0.2    | 0.04       |
        | 6    | 0.8     | 0.64       |
        | 4    | -1.2    | 1.44       |
        | 5    | -0.2    | 0.04       |
        | 7    | 1.8     | 3.24       |
        | 6    | 0.8     | 0.64       |
        | 5    | -0.2    | 0.04       |
        | 6    | 0.8     | 0.64       |
        | 5    | -0.2    | 0.04       |

        Sum of squared deviations: Σ (x(i)-x̄)² = 23.6

        s² = 23.6 / (15 - 1) = 23.6 / 14 ≈ 1.686


    Step 3: Compute lag-1 autocorrelation
        Formula:  ρ(1) = Σ[(x(i)-x̄)(x(i+1)-x̄)] / Σ[(x(i)-x̄)²]

        Compute numerator Σ[(x(i)-x̄)(x(i+1)-x̄)]:

        | i | x(i)-x̄  | x(i+1)-x̄  | Product |
        |1  | -3.2    | -1.2      | 3.84    |
        |2  | -1.2    | 0.8       | -0.96   |
        |3  | 0.8     | -0.2      | -0.16   |
        |4  | -0.2    | -1.2      | 0.24    |
        |5  | -1.2    | 1.8       | -2.16   |
        |6  | 1.8     | -0.2      | -0.36   |
        |7  | -0.2    | 0.8       | -0.16   |
        |8  | 0.8     | -1.2      | -0.96   |
        |9  | -1.2    | -0.2      | 0.24    |
        |10 | -0.2    | 1.8       | -0.36   |
        |11 | 1.8     | 0.8       | 1.44    |
        |12 | 0.8     | -0.2      | -0.16   |
        |13 | -0.2    | 0.8       | -0.16   |
        |14 | 0.8     | -0.2      | -0.16   |

        Numerator = 0.6
        Denominator = Σ (x(i)-x̄)² = 23.6

        ρ(1) = 0.6 / 23.6 ≈ 0.0254 ≈ 0.03


    Step 4: Adjusted variance of the mean
        Formula:  Var(x̄) = (s² / n) * (1 + 2ρ(1))

        Var(x̄) = (1.686 / 15) * (1 + 2*0.03)  
        Var(x̄) = 0.1124 * 1.06 ≈ 0.119

    Step 5: 95% Confidence Interval
        Formula:  CI = x̄ ± Z_{α/2} * sqrt(Var(x̄))  
        Z_{0.025} = 1.96

        sqrt(Var(x̄)) = sqrt(0.119) ≈ 0.345

        CI = 5.2 ± 1.96 * 0.345  
        CI = 5.2 ± 0.676  

        CI = [5.2 - 0.676, 5.2 + 0.676] = [4.524, 5.876]

    Interpretation:
        - We are 95% confident that the true mean waiting time lies between 4.52 and 5.88 minutes.  
        - Autocorrelation is very small (ρ(1) ≈ 0.03), so outputs are nearly independent.  
        - If autocorrelation were larger, the variance would increase, and a longer simulation run would be needed for more accurate estimates.
